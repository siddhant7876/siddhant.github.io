Hey there, 
I am Siddhant, currently a dual degree student at IIT Kanpur in the department of Mathematics and Scientific Computing.
I have demonstrated experience in Statistical Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Quantative Finance and statistical research through various projects and competitions that I have completed. I have also interned at Wells Fargo as a front-end developer.
Apart from this, I am a big fan of football and cricket. I also love listening to music and playing guitar (Still Learning). Currently looking out for research opportunity in NLP and Quantative Finance. Hope to Connect with you!!
